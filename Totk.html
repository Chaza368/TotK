	<h2><center><u>Summary:</u></h2>
	  <p><center>Tears of the Kingdom is the most ambitious in the <b>'Legend of Zelda Franchise'</b> thus far.
	  It is very unique due to its variety of unique abilities, questlines and much more!<BR>
	  There are also new items in the game called <a href="Totk_Page2.html"><b>Zonai Devices</b></a>, which are objects that each have their own 
	  purpose/function to allow the player to build virtually any contraptions or vehicles they can imagine!</p>

    <h2><u>What are their Functions?</u></h2>
	  <h3 id="UltrahandAbility">Ultrahand:</h3>
	    <p>The ultrahand ability allows the player to grab and move any moveable object or item in the game.<BR>
	    Players are also able to rotate the object and even attach two or more objects together (21 being the limit).<BR> 
	    With the new introduction of <a href="Totk_Page2.html">Zonai Devices</a>, players can attach objects such as
	    fans and wheels to construction materials such as wooden planks to create various contraptions.</p>
	    <img src="Ultrahand.png" width="130px">
	    <p>Many side quests involve using this ability to complete tasks such as clearing a blocked path,
	    building bridges or even creating carts.<BR>
	    Also, when creating your dream home in Tarrey Town, ultrahand is used to assemble the different rooms.<BR>
		Finally, ultrahand is also used in the majority of the game's <a href="#Shrines"><b>shrines</b></a>, 
		excluding the <a href="#Rauru's_Blessing_Shrines">`Rauru's Blessing` shrines.</a></p>
		
		<BR><BR><BR>
     
	  <h3 id="FuseAbility" align="right">Fuse:</h3> 
	    <p align="right">The fuse ability lets players combine any of the total 829 fuseable items, objects to either a melee weapon or shield<BR>
		You can also fuse any item or zonai device capsule to an arrow, letting you shoot various items, dealing different 
		amounts of damage and having different effects based on what type of item they are.<BR>
		Fire based items attached to arrows burn the target upon impact, ice items fused to arrows freeze the target upon impact etc.<BR>
		In general, most items/objects fused to a shield or sword will increase its damage or durability (although some weapons, often 
		bone based items, break after a few uses, leaving the original weapon in its unfused state.</p>
		<img src="Fuse.png" align="right" width="140px"><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
	    <p align="right">It is also worth mentioning that you can fuse any bow, melee weapon or shield to another melee weapon or shield
		(with the exception of the Master Sword). This can increase the damage and durability and in some cases, even the range
		eg. fusing two  spears.<BR>
		In order for something to be fused, the item you are fusing something to needs to be in your inventory, and the other item on the ground.<BR>
		Fusing elemental items (dragon parts or sapphire, ruby topaz or opals) will activate an elemental move, respective to the fused material,
		each time you use the shield/weapon.<BR>
		Using a magic rod or sceptor, these abilities can be enhanced further.<BR>
		Do note that items can only be fused to <i>one</i> other item.<BR>
		The 'ancient blade' has a unique ability when fused to an arrow, that it will instantly destroy any monster it hits, however you cannot
		then collect the drops from that monster.<BR>
		Finally, the fuseable item with the most base damage is the 'silver lynel saber horn', with a damage of 55!</p>
		
        <BR><BR><BR>
		
      <h3 id="AscendAbility">Ascend:</h3>
	    <p>The ascend ability allows the player to rise up and, as the name implies, ascend, through any solid surface above.<BR>
		The ability does have a range, however. A surface too high up will be indicated by a red grid pattern with an empty centre
		showing on it.<BR>
		A surface within range, but blocked is indicated by a red grid pattern with a red circle in the centre on the surface.<BR>
		A surface which can be ascended through is shown by a blue grid pattern with a blue circle in the centre.</p>
        <img src="Ascend.png" width="120px">
		<p>After successfully ascending through a surface, the player can then choose to climb out of the gound or descend back down.<BR>
		When paired with zonai devices such as the <a href="#HoverStone">hover stone</a>, the ascend ability can be easiy utilised to
		rise up through many surfaces throughout Hyrule.</p>
		
	  <h3 id="RecallAbility" align=right>Recall:</h3>
	    <p align=right>The recall ability alows the player to rewind/reverse an object's recent motion.<BR>
		For example, if a player were to throw a rock, the rock's movement could be reversed,
		returning it to its original position.<BR>
		This can also take place when an object is in the air, which can be used for a variety of things:</p>
	    <p align=right>
	    <b>- Propelling a <a href="#Wing">Zonai wing device<a/>.<BR>
		- Making an object fall directly down (if an recall is disabled on an object in the air, the object
		fall directly down).<BR>
		- Landing objects on enemies to deal damage to them e.g. a gunpowder barrel.<BR>
		<b/></p>

	<h2 id="basic_info_ZD" align="left"><u>Basic Info:</u></h2>
    <ul>
	    <li align="left">Zonai devices activate when hit by an item from the player (e.g a thrown rock or a hit from the player's sword).</li> 
	    <li align="left">All zonai devices attached together in some way (or attached to other things e.g. wooden boards, logs) will activate when any part of the contraption is hit.</li>
	    <li align="left">Most zonai devices will deactivate once the player's energy cell charge has fully depleted</li>
		<li align="left">Wearing the full <a href="#zonai_armour_set">zonai armour set</a> will drastically increase the efficiency of the player's zonai devices with regards to energy consumption</li>

	<h2><u>All 27 Zonai Devices</u></h2>
	    <p>Sorted alphabetically for your covenience :)</p>

    <BR>

	  <h3 id="Balloon_ZD">The Balloon</h3>
      <img src="balloon.png" width="140px">
	    <p align="left">BLANK</p>
		<p style="color: darkcyan;">It can be found in dispensers in the following locations: BLANK</p> 
	  
	  
	  <h3 id="Battery_ZD">The Battery</h3>
      <img src="battery.png" width="75px">
	    <p align="left">The Battery is a device which lets the user extend the duration of the other devices' power outputs, acting as extra energy cell charge.
		For example, attaching a battery to a vehicle would power all devices attached to the vehicle when turned on for a short while, using up charge from the
	    battery. Once depleted, the player's energy cell charge will begin to be consumed to continue powering the devices. Batteries can be stacked to increase the
		duration of power provided from them. Once depleted, the batteries will disappear. Only when attached
		do the batteries power devices.</p>
		<p style="color: darkcyan;">It can be found in dispensers in the following locations: South Eldin Sky Archipelago, Digdogg Suspension Bridge, Death Mountain Depths,
		Bravery Island, Wellspring Island, Thunderhead Isles & South Lanayru Sky Archipelago.</p>
	
	
      <h3 id="Fan_ZD">The Fan</h3>
	  <img src="fan.png" width="130px">
	    <p align="left">The fan is a very useful item in Totk. It allows the player to attach it to a build in order to provide some form of propulsion, 
		blowing air in the direction it faces for the duration of the player's energy cell capacity. When not attached or placed face up, the fan can move around by itself.
		It can be fused to a weapon, shield (or Mineru) in order to gain the desired effects. It is commonly used in nearly all vehicles in the game. 
		<p style="color: darkcyan;">It can be found in dispensers in the following locations: Wellspring Island, Thunderhead Isles, Tarrey Town, South Eldin Sky Archipelago, Lanayru Sky Archipelago, Kakariko Village,
		Great Sky Island, East Hebra Sky Archipelago & Courage Island.</p>
